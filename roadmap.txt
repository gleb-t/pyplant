[] Long-term multi-run storage that keeps multiple versions of ingredients.
   This would help to reduce the execution time of repeated experiments.
[] Complain about allocated huge arrays that haven't been sent out.
[] Complain about allocated arrays that aren't sent with huge_Array type.
[] Allow allocation of temporary huge arrays.
[] Improve manifest/warehouse resilience to crashes (e.g. resizable dataset can mess things up).
[] Auto-add all reactors (a separate function, maybe?)
[] Clear the cache/manifest if the PyPlant's version has changed.
[] Allow to export an ingredient with some metadata. This later can be fed into the plant as some special 'fixed'
   ingredient. The point is to provide easier reproducibility, so that no extra code needs to be written to
   recreate some old result.


[!] Test for reactors (with subreactors) fetching their own ingredients. + Robustness test for merging
    two reactors into one (and now fetching your own ingredients.). This shouldn't break the plant.
